        " \n",
        "When I was 16 years old I lived the changes created by the last great global financial crisis, which hit Spain extremely hard in 2011. I remember a change in the lifestyles of all people I knew and myself. There is an image of all the businesses in main streets of my city, Cordova, shut down that made a tremendous contrast with what I had been experiencing until that moment and that I know consider opulence. What was until then a normal commodity became a luxury item, and some basic needs became a commodity. Public healthcare went semi-privatised in some regions and thousands of young people who had abbandoned their studies to go to work got stranded in a situation of unemployment or working in the black economy. Spain never got totally recovered from that crisis. \n",
        "\n",
        "That crisis made deep changes in how people lived and how people acted towards most aspects of our life. Yet, it is very difficult to reach a certain level of information or data about the specific changes that happened in a certain place. \n",
        "\n",
        "**The objective:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The only aim of this project is to gather and explain analyse data related to the economic activity of the city of Cordova now with the only purpose of making it available for the possibility of repeating and comparing the same analysis after the COVID-19 Pandemic.\n",
        "\n",
        "##**Córdoba**\n",
        "\n",
        "The city that is going to be studied is Cordova (Córdoba),located in the southern Spanish region of Andalusia and with a population close to 330 thousand people. (Ayto. Córdoba, 2019). \n",
        "\n",
        "**History**\n",
        "\n",
        "Cordova has a long history, having existed at least since the eight century b.C. In the year 711 a.C. it became the capital of what would become the Al-Andalus empire, growing to a population close to the million of inhabitants. Many of the historic places that have been bringing tourists to the city until now have their origin in that historic period. After the decadence of the empire and its collapse the city was concered by the northern kingdom of Castilla in 1236 (Turismo de Córdoba, s.f.).\n",
        "\n",
        "It is remarcable to know that, almost 800 years after that, the economy of the city has been running, in part, thanks to the people that come to visit the historic places of that period. The _Mezquita-catedral de Córdoba_ alone was visited by almost two million people in 2019 (Europa Press, 2019).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Gastronomics**\n",
        "\n",
        "Another important economic motor of the city is Gastronomics. Some of the most famous foods of Spain have its origin in the region. Which is why it is also an influent factor in turism (Luque, A., 2020).\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Spring festivals**\n",
        "\n",
        "The moment in which the quarantine has been declares makes it possible that it will be coincident with some of the most important festivities of the city, which are concentrated in April and May. Those festivities are responsible for bringing thousands of people to Córdoba, and some of the most important of those have already been canceled or delayed (Ávalos, R. 2020).\n",
        "\n",
        "It is accepted that the turism is a fundamental axis for the economy of the city. That turism has been notably affected by the current Pandemic, which is expected to cause looses running to millions of euros for the local economy (Cordópolis, 2020). How will that situation shape the local economy in the next years is yet to be seen.\n",
