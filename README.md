# Project: Futures of Cordova


Futures of Cordoba
 Applied Data Science Capstone Project
 

This is the final project for the completion of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. 

The current idea for this project is considerably different from the one that was being considered before. That change has been caused by the considerable effect that the global COVID-19 Pandemic is causing right now and by the possibility that my country, Spain, will enter a recession again. For that reason, the starting point of that project is a very personal one. However, this will not prevent me from taking a point of view as objective as possible. If there is any inconsistency in the project, it would be of great help to know it so that it can be corrected.
